 * An implementation of vanillas ContainerData that splits integers into two separate shorts.

 * ClientBoundContainerSetDataPacket serializes ints into shorts causing loss of data when the
 * int is outside the range of -32768 and 32767. IntContainerData doubles the array size and
 * stores the values as shorts making the data compatible with vanillas networking.
 * <p>
 * The Set and Get methods are made final and marked as deprecated to maintain compatibility,
 * instead being replaced by setInt and getInt. getCount is also made final and marked as
 * deprecated with getSize() as its replacement.
 * <p>
 * These new methods take into account the doubled array size so that standard indexing can be used
 * the same as it would with ContainerData and SimpleContainerData.
